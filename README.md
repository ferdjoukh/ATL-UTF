# ATLrunner

This project is an ATL model transformations runner.

## Structure of input folders

The input folder (containing model transformations) must follow a specific structure.

This structure is described [here](https://github.com/ferdjoukh/ATLrunner/blob/master/documentation/tranformations-folder.md)

### Init a model transformation folder

This [bash](https://github.com/ferdjoukh/ATLrunner/blob/master/init-MT.sh) script can be used to init the correct structure of a folder containing the model transformation.
Mainly, a pre-filled file **mt.infos** is created.
